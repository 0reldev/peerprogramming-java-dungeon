# Dungeon

## Educational Java exercice from Wild Code School

### Instructions 

>You are the dungeon master : your party of adventurers has slain the dragon, now they want to share the gold of each treasure.
>
>Instead of opening all the treasures and share the amount equally, the party has decided to open one treasure at a time : the adventurer keeping the gold he found >inside.
>
>But there is a catch! Each treasure has many forms of protection : a physical resistance, a spell resistance and a lockpicking resistance.
>
>Each adventurer will try to open the next treasure, if it doesn't succeed, the treasure is magically destroyed!
>
>* The warrior will use his brute force, relying on his strength.
>* The wizard will use a spell, relying on his intelligence.
>* The thief will use a lock pick, relying on his dexterity.
>
>You'll have to create the classes, has shown on this class diagram :
>
>![Dungeon's Class Diagram](dungeon_diagram.png)
>
>Then, modify the `Dungeon` main function to implement the creation of the party members and the treasures opening.
>
>After that, you're free to improve the program : you can add battles with monsters, random traps, a dungeon represented as a two-dimensional array...
